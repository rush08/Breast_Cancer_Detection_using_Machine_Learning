# Breast_Cancer_Detection_using_Machine_Learning
Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning is a project that leverages classification algorithms to predict the presence of breast cancer based on patient data. Using datasets like the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset, the model applies techniques such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Support Vector Machines (SVM).
