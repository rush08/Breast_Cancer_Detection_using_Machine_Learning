Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning
Project Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the presence of breast cancer based on various features from patient data. The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD), which contains information such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and others to classify tumors as either benign or malignant. We apply machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to provide an early and reliable detection tool for breast cancer.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.
Feature Selection: Identifying the most important features for accurate prediction.
Model Building: Implementing and training machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
Visualization: Visualizing the dataset, model performance, and prediction results.
Technologies Used
Python: The main programming language for building the model.
Scikit-learn: Library used for building machine learning models and evaluation.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
Jupyter Notebook: For executing and presenting the code.

Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load data
# X, y = load_data()  # Your code for loading the data

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = SVC(kernel='linear')
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy}")
